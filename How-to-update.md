Make sure that both softwares are updated (Arduino code and Android application) otherwise some features may not work as expected. 

# Updating Arduino:  
1. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). (It's free)  
2. Open [this code](https://github.com/michalmonday/supremeDuck/blob/master/source/supremeDuck.ino) in Arduino IDE.  
3. Pick: "Tools -> Board -> Arduino Leonardo".  
4. Make sure the device is connected to PC and pick: "Tools -> Port -> COM X (Arduino Leonardo)".  
5. Upload the code by clicking the "Upload" button in the top left corner.  
6. It should be done.

The steps from 3 to 5 are presented in the following video (step 3 starts at 2:20):
