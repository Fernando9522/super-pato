**Brief description:**  
Thanks to it the device will work with any language setting on the target PC. (works on Windows only)


**Explanation:**  
The MultiLang method is a method relying on the very useful feature of Windows. Windows allows the user to hold "alt" key and input ASCII value of a character using the numpad. Taking advantage of this feature it is possible to type special characters regardless of the language setting on the PC.

The MultiLang method seems flawless in compatison with the encoding method adapted from the HAK5 rubber duckys' encoder which doesn't provide 100% reliability in all languages.
